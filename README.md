# 🔄 Ralph in Gemini CLI Extension

> *"Iteration over perfection"*

**Ralph** is an extension for the Gemini CLI that enables **autonomous, self-improving development loops**. It allows you to task the AI with a complex goal, and the AI will iterate on it until it is genuinely complete.

```

### Option 2: Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arman1o1/ralph-gemini-cli.git

pip install -e .
gemini extensions install .
```

## 🚀 How to Use (The "Ralph Loop")

A Ralph Loop has three stages: **Start**, **Iterate**, and **Finish**.

### 1. Start a Loop

Tell Ralph what you want to build. This initiates the state file.

```bash
ralph start "Build a Python script that scrapes headlines from news.ycombinator.com"
```

**Options:**

- `-m 10`: Limit to 10 iterations (prevents infinite loops).
- `-p "ALL TESTS PASS"`: Set a "Completion Promise". The loop will only end when the AI confirms this condition is true.

### 2. Iterate (Automatic)

Once started, the AI (`ralph-gemini-cli`) will enter an autonomous mode where it:

1. Reads the state file.
2. Performs a unit of work (e.g., creates a file, runs a test).
3. Runs `ralph iterate` to log progress.
4. Repeats until finished.

### 3. Check Status

You can check the progress at any time:

```bash
ralph status
```

Or view the full history:

```bash
ralph history
```

### 4. Stop/Cancel

If the loop gets stuck or you want to stop it manually:

```bash
ralph cancel
```

## 💻 Command Reference

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ralph start <prompt>` | Start a new loop with the given task. |
| `ralph iterate -s <summary>` | manually advance the loop (mostly used by the AI itself). |
| `ralph status` | Show current iteration, active status, and promise. |
| `ralph history` | Show a log of all iterations in the current loop. |
| `ralph cancel` | Stop the current loop immediately. |
| `ralph resume` | Resume a previously stopped loop. |

-----

## 📁 Configuration & State

The extension maintains a state file at `.gemini/ralph-loop.local.md` in your workspace.

- **Do not edit this file manually** unless you know what you are doing.
- It contains the prompt, iteration count, and execution history.
